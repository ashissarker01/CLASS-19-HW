            Normally, sport bikes are not recommended for beginner motorcycle
            riders, although some companies do offer sport bikes with slightly
            less power than others. This does not mean they're fast they're just
            not as fast as your standard sport bike

            Dirt bike riding is a workout. As well as strengthening your core
            and toning your muscles, dirt bike riding has numerous health
            benefits that are an advantage for your overall fitness and health.

            BMW motorcycles are generally very durable and can be seen lasting
            about 200,000 miles; however, this does vary depending on the model,
            how well the bike is maintained, and the style of riding it is
            subject to. If you average 4000 miles per year, a well-kept BMW
            motorcycle can last 50 years

            Harley-Davidson motorcycles are made to last. With their durable
            assembly matched with their revolutionary engines, these bikes are
            incredibly durable. Plus, most of their parts are easily
            replaceable; meaning that you can purchase new parts when they
            become damaged or well-worn instead of buying an entirely new bike.

            do a 200 Km drive in one shot(i.e non stop). Driving a bullet feels
            like boosting attitude(recommended, before going for an interview,
            ride a bullet on the way :-)p). And a convincing mileage and also an
            good performer.

            Great bike, better customer service! You might need assembling as
            the front tire comes unmounted so you have to hold the bike up while
            doing that & attaching brake assembly. (floor jack helps) Pretty
            easy though & I know little about mechanic work. I also changed the
